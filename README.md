# atmospheric-corrosion-app
This is an application that provides information on stainless steel materials that are suitable for a user-specified environment. This application was developed specifically for SASSDA clients that wish to construct within an environment that is susceptible to atmoshperic corrosion, e.g., near an ocean or salt source.

The application was created using the Flet library -> https://flet.dev/, which I highly recommend!!!
